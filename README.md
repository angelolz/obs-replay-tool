# OBS Replay Tool
This was made as a way for me to try and make OBS a good (maybe even better) alternative to GeForce Experience.
I thought about doing this because of how much customization when using OBS's Replay Buffer tool instead of Instant Replay from GeForce Experience. For example, in OBS I can record up to 6 different audio tracks, as compared to GE's two tracks limitation. This allows me to separate game audio, mic audio, and Discord call audio.

This is currently a work in progress right now, but from testing it works so far, although I do want to add some features.

# Setup
1. Clone this repo.
2. Install dependencies: `npm i`
4. Run `electron index.js` in the terminal.
5. A `config.json` file should be automatically created with the default settings.
6. Fill in the websocket authentication information, as well as other required fields.
7. You should see a "üîÅ" icon in the bottom left corner of your screen if your replay is on, and a "üîÅ + ‚ùå" icon when it is off.

# TODO
- add option to pick which corner to show overlay
- put replays in their own game's folders
